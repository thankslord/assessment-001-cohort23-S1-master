* Use the `quotes.txt` file for the list of quotees amd quotes to select from.
* You can run the program using the instructions in *To Run* below.
* You can test technical correctness by running the unit tests as in the section *To Test* below.
* You will be required to create `myfile.txt` containing `Walt Disney ~ All our dreams can come true,if we have the courage to pursue them.` to pass that required unittest.

### To Run

* `python3 quote_system.py`
* follow the input prompts to run the program

### To Test

* To run all the unittests: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_quote_system.py`
* To run a specific step's unittest, e.g step *1*: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_quote_system.MyTestCase.test_1_choose_quote_file`
